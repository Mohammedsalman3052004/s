        content="The cybersecurity landscape is undergoing a dramatic transformation, fueled by the convergence of rapid AI innovation, tightening regulations, and evolving threat vectors. As digital transformation accelerates, security has become not just a technical challenge but a boardroom priority.At the RSA Conference 2025&amp;nbsp;in San Francisco, our Enterprise Technology and Services team explored how global cybersecurity leaders are reimagining defense strategies to address the growing sophistication of attackers and the vulnerabilities introduced by AI and emerging technologies. We’ve noted some of the most compelling insights and takeaways.Critical factors driving the enhanced focus on cybersecurity include a rise in sophisticated threat actors, growing regulatory pressures, and the increasing complexity of digital environments.A Growing List of Threat ActorsCybersecurity teams are facing a growing list of threat actors exploiting gaps in enterprise infrastructure. One major concern is authorization sprawl, where users have redundant or excessive permissions across cloud and SaaS environments. This creates hidden attack paths and hampers an organization&#39;s ability to effectively map and monitor access across distributed systems, weakening overall detection and response. Additionally, the rise of Industrial Control System (ICS) ransomware is a growing risk as companies automate their operational technology (OT) environments to reduce human error. In doing so, they often remove manual fallbacks critical for system recovery, creating single points of failure that can be exploited to disrupt essential services. Compounding these challenges is the tactic of forensic artifact erasure, where advanced threat actors deliberately avoid creating or actively erase digital forensic traces, making post-breach analysis and attribution far more difficult.AI Security: A Dual-Edged SwordWhile AI enhances defensive capabilities, it also introduces new vulnerabilities. Tools like WormGPT and AI-powered DDoS engines from hacker groups such as FunkSec highlight the growing use of AI by malicious actors. Alarmingly, only 30% of organizations currently view AI as a supply chain risk, underscoring the need for urgent reassessment.Regulatory Compliance and SEC MandatesWith the SEC’s cybersecurity disclosure rules (Items 1.05 and 106) now in effect, organizations are under increasing pressure to demonstrate robust cyber risk governance and breach transparency. Compliance has become a fundamental aspect of investor communications and enterprise risk management.Threats in the Era of Quantum ComputingQuantum computing presents a looming challenge to current encryption protocols. Security leaders are being urged to transition to post-quantum cryptographic methods and improve crypto-agility. The window for proactive preparation is closing rapidly.Key solutions, frameworks, and trends that emerged include security by design principles, identity-based access models, and the integration of AI-driven tools in cybersecurity operations.Security by DesignThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) unveiled its &quot;Secure by Design&quot; initiative, bringing together 68 major tech firms including Microsoft, Google, and IBM to embed security at the product development stage. This may well evolve into a game-changing industry standard.The Shift to Identity-Based SecurityTraditional network segmentation approaches such as VLANs, ACLs, and firewalls are proving inadequate for today’s dynamic environments. The future lies in identity-based micro-segmentation, which takes into account user identity, device attributes, and behavior patterns. Strong authentication mechanisms that validate both user and endpoint identity are critical to implementing an effective zero trust architecture.Convergence of Network and Endpoint SecurityTo protect unmanaged devices and privacy-sensitive environments, enterprises are increasingly integrating network and endpoint security. Enterprise browsers are emerging as pivotal tools by offering enhanced visibility and protection, particularly in hybrid work scenarios. These developments align with Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) frameworks and reflect a broader move toward unified security architectures.GenAI and Agentic AI Reshaping Cybersecurity OperationsGenerative AI is moving beyond hype to become a functional asset. Vendors demonstrated how large language models (LLMs) are being embedded into SIEM, SOAR, and threat intelligence platforms to reduce mean time to detect (MTTD) and respond (MTTR), streamline communication, and automate routine tasks. AI-powered assistants are accelerating SOC analyst onboarding and boosting incident response capabilities. Agentic workflows are set to revolutionize cybersecurity by enabling complex problem-solving, iterative learning, and agent collaboration.Human-Centric Incident Response Gaining GroundCyber resilience increasingly depends on how teams perform under pressure, not just the tools at their disposal. This year’s conference emphasized the human side of cybersecurity—from leadership and communication to cross-functional collaboration. Cohesive, well-trained teams are proving to be vital in managing incidents effectively.Software Supply Chain Security as a Frontline IssueOrganizations are shifting from reactive breach containment to proactive risk mitigation. Frameworks such as SLSA (Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts) and Software Bills of Materials (SBOMs) are gaining widespread adoption. AI and ML tools are being used to automate vulnerability scanning and real-time remediation, bolstering the resilience of software supply chains across sectors.As cybersecurity challenges become more complex and increasingly critical to business continuity, the takeaways from the RSA Conference 2025 reinforce the urgency of adopting a forward-looking, AI-aware, and human-centric approach to cyber defence. Enterprises that invest in resilience today will be best positioned to thrive in an increasingly unpredictable digital world.">

                    <p><b>Family Offices in India: From Legacy to Leadership – Broadwings' Perspective</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>In India’s evolving wealth landscape, few structures represent foresight and financial maturity as distinctly as the Family Office. While still an emerging concept for many, Family Offices are fast becoming central to the governance, preservation, and growth of large family wealth.<br><br></p>
                    <p>At Broadwings Family Office, we have had the privilege of guiding some of India’s most influential families through this transition—transforming capital into continuity, and wealth into legacy.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>🧭 Reimagining Wealth Stewardship</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>Two decades ago, the term Family Office was rare in Indian boardrooms. Today, it is quietly reshaping how wealthy families operate—privately held, strategically driven, and entirely focused on long-term wealth preservation.<br><br></p>
                    <p>A Family Office, in its essence, is a bespoke institutional framework—one that allows families to maintain control while delegating execution to a professional team that understands their ethos, ambitions, and risk appetite.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>🕰 A Legacy Model with Modern Relevance</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>The Family Office model has historical roots dating back to the 15th century. The Medici family, pioneers of structured wealth governance, integrated art, finance, and innovation to shape not just their fortune—but the future.<br><br></p>
                    <p>In the 19th century, J.P. Morgan institutionalised the concept in modern finance—combining private advisory with influence, foresight, and social capital.<br><br></p>
                    <p>Today, Indian families are charting their own version of this narrative, blending tradition with a more global, digitised worldview.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>💼 What Does a Family Office Do?</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>At its core, a Family Office is a private, full-service advisory firm focused solely on managing the affairs of one or multiple high-net-worth families. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Investment Management – public markets, alternatives, private equity, real estate</li>
                      <li>Succession & Estate Planning – trusts, wills, and intergenerational wealth transfer</li>
                      <li>Philanthropy & Impact – structured giving, cause alignment, governance</li>
                      <li>Consolidated Reporting – performance dashboards, multi-asset aggregation</li>
                      <li>Family Governance – family constitutions, charters, and conflict resolution</li>
                      <li>Global Mobility & Structuring – citizenship, tax jurisdictions, and cross-border compliance</li>
                    </ul><br>
                  
                    <p><b>🔍 Types of Family Offices</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>Broadly, Family Offices in India adopt one of two structures:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><b>Single Family Office (SFO):</b> Built around one family, this model is tailored, private, and resource-intensive.</li>
                      <li><b>Multi-Family Office (MFO):</b> Shared infrastructure across multiple families, offering flexibility and economies of scale.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Both structures can be deeply customised, with Broadwings providing advisory and infrastructure to support either journey.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>💰 How Much Does It Cost?</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>A Family Office typically costs between 0.30% to 0.50% of AUM annually, depending on its structure, geography, and sophistication. For a family with ₹800 crore (approx. USD 100 million) or more in investable assets, this translates to ₹2.5–4 crore per year.<br><br></p>
                    <p>Cost, however, is not the only consideration. Efficiency, control, and legacy continuity often outweigh pure expenses—especially when the alternative is fragmented decision-making or generational disconnects.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>📈 When Is the Right Time?</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>Some of the common triggers for families to formalise a Family Office include:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A liquidity event such as an IPO, M&A transaction, or sale of a business</li>
                      <li>A significant inheritance or asset transfer to the next generation</li>
                      <li>An increased need for privacy, governance, or family education</li>
                      <li>Complex cross-border wealth, or exposure to new asset classes</li>
                      <li>A desire to move from reactive investing to institutional-grade planning</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At Broadwings, we help families assess readiness—through frameworks that consider asset scale, complexity, and strategic intent.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>📊 Trends Reshaping Family Offices in India</b><br><br></p>
                    <ol>
                      <li><b>Family Offices as Integrated Hubs:</b> No longer just about investments, today’s Family Offices are multidisciplinary—handling legal, compliance, HR, philanthropy, even brand reputation.</li>
                      <li><b>Next-Gen Leadership & Digital Transformation:</b> India’s rising generation is driving digitisation, ESG orientation, and cross-border diversification—requiring smarter tools, real-time reporting, and agile strategies.</li>
                      <li><b>Private Markets & Venture Investing:</b> Startups and alternatives are increasingly attractive. In 2023 alone, Indian Family Offices invested over USD 850 million in FinTech, as they seek higher alpha beyond traditional equity and debt.</li>
                      <li><b>Globalisation of Wealth:</b> Second and third generations are adopting a global lens—exploring investment migration, international philanthropy, and offshore structures.</li>
                      <li><b>Sustainability & Purpose:</b> With ESG metrics gaining ground, more families are reimagining what “impact” means—not just in returns, but in societal value creation.</li>
                    </ol><br>
                  
                    <p><b>🧬 A Vehicle for Generational Continuity</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>While not mandated by regulation yet in India, Family Offices are fast becoming the preferred model for families seeking enduring control, customised solutions, and institutional rigour.<br><br></p>
                    <p>At Broadwings, we believe a well-structured Family Office is more than an administrative entity. It is a custodian of vision, values, and legacy—tailored to each family’s journey and aspirations.<br><br></p>
                  
                    <p><b>🤝 Considering a Family Office?</b><br><br></p>
                    <p>We partner with families at various stages—whether you're assessing readiness, setting up governance frameworks, or seeking to digitise an existing office.<br><br></p>
                    <p>If you're exploring what a Family Office could look like for your family, we’re here to help you design a structure that is agile, resilient, and future-ready.</p>
