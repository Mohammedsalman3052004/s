                        <p>We may share your personal information with Broadwings Entities and service providers and this
                            may involve transferring it to countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) whose data
                            protection laws may not be as extensive as those which apply to us. Where we do so, we will
                            ensure that we do this in accordance with the Acts and take appropriate measures to ensure
                            that the level of protection which applies to your personal information processed in these
                            countries is similar to that which applies within the EEA. Such measures may include only
                            transferring your data to jurisdictions in respect of which there is a European Commission
                            adequacy decision or, where this is not the case, by using model clauses which have been
                            approved by the European Commission which are available <a

                        <p>We may transfer your personal information between businesses that are legally part of the
                            Broadwings Entities for the purposes of providing our services to you as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>from our businesses based in the United Kingdom to our businesses based in India or the
                                United States of America on the basis that we have established Data Processing
                                Agreements containing model clauses as required under GDPR; and</li>
                            <li>from our businesses based in India or the US to our businesses based in the United
                                Kingdom on the basis that the United Kingdom is an authorised jurisdiction for the
                                purposes of the relevant Acts.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h5>Your rights</h5>
                        <p>You have the right to request a copy of the personal data about you, which we hold, to have
                            any inaccurate personal data corrected and to object to or restrict our using your personal
                            data. You may also make a complaint if you have a concern about our handling of your
                            personal data.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to do any of the above, please send an email to awmplcompliance@Broadwings.com We
                            may request that you prove your identity by providing us with a copy of a valid means of
                            identification in order for us to comply with our security obligations and to prevent
                            unauthorised disclosure of data.</p>
                        <p>When we receive such a request we will endeavour to provide you with these details without
                            delay and at the latest within one month of receipt. We may extend the period of compliance
                            by a further two months where requests are complex or numerous. In such instances Broadwings
                            will inform you within one month of the receipt of the request and explain why the extension
                            is necessary.</p>
                        <p>When Broadwings receives a subject access request we will provide a copy of the information held
                            free of charge. Broadwings may charge a reasonable fee to comply with requests for further
                            copies of the same information. This does not mean that we will charge for all subsequent
                            access requests rather that the Broadwings reserves the right to charge a fee based on the
                            administrative cost of providing the information.</p>
                        <p>If after reviewing a request, we believe a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive,
                            particularly if it is repetitive, then Broadwings may charge a ‘reasonable fee’ which will be
                            decided on a case by case basis. In certain circumstances may even refuse to respond to such
                            requests. You also have the following rights (unless exemptions apply), which can be
                            exercised by contacting us using the details provided below:</p>

                                significance and the envisaged consequences of this processing; and</li>
                            <li>To lodge a complaint about the way in which your personal data is being used to your
